# 🛍 Trendify AI – Virtual Shopping Assistant  

## 1. Background  
In today’s world of e-commerce, customers face challenges in choosing products that match their style, budget, and preferences. While online stores provide massive catalogs, they lack personalized guidance.  
To address this gap, we developed *Trendify AI*, a virtual shopping assistant powered by AI.  
It combines *LLMs (Google Gemini API)* with a modern frontend to deliver a personalized, engaging, and efficient shopping experience.

## 🌐 Backend Branch

Alongside the main frontend application, there is a dedicated **backend branch** that contains isolated backend code.

### Purpose of Backend Branch
- Provides a **Node.js + Express server** for API handling.  
- Allows **secure API key management** (instead of exposing keys in frontend).  
- Handles requests to **Gemini API** and forwards responses to the frontend.  
- Can be extended for future features like authentication, database integration, and advanced product management.  

### Usage
The backend branch is separate from the main branch to keep codebases clean.  

Developers can switch to it when working on server-side logic:  
```bash
git checkout backend
```
Run backend locally (example):
```
npm install
npm run server
```

⚡ This ensures the frontend (main branch) and backend (backend branch) remain isolated but can be integrated when needed.
